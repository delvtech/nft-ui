        As Wyn and Jannalor jumped in their boat seeking for a new land. For
        days and nights they sailed in the raging Sea of Liquidity, unsure of
        what theyâ€™d find.

        Since the Faorin centralized control of their region, the towers in the
        city had become taller and brighter. Yet tales of arbitrary suffering

        of the annual harvests increased.

      <p>
        Only one thing was certain: there had to be a better way. They found
        adventurers from myriad backgrounds upon exploring. Wyn and Jannalar had
        been researchers, studying the minute details of the origins of high
        elvish magic, but what they found here was new even to them.
