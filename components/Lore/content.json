        "Our magic will grow stronger together,” Jannalor replied. Experimenting with spices from their new neighbours, they turned to a crop called Bacchae, long outlawed in the Old World for being too degenerate.",

        "Since the plebs invaded, the city grew shinier and more uwu, but airdrops had all dried up. Only promises of POAPs remained, which nobody knew how to claim. Yet tales of rugging grew with constant Sybil attacks in high VC season. “The rug really tied the room together,” bemoaned Wyn. Only one thing was certain: devs HAD to do something.",

Wyn and Jannalor had been rotating shape shifters, studying the minute details of the origins of hentai “high” elvish magic, but what they found here looked rare even to them. “Jannalor!” said Wyn. “Just like us, there have to be others…other degens who seek The Way of the Chad. We must find them! We must seek the anime anons!”"

        "Together, our magic will grow more based,” Jannalor replied. Experimenting with the dankest spices from their neighbours’ L2 farms, they learned to rotate their crops, with APYs banned for being too degenerate and not mobile compatible. “Looks rare”, they exclaimed. They feared they were ngmi, but they knew that the minute they stopped experimenting, trolls would make a shitty fork funded by Dragonsky.",

Holding hands in a Governance Steering Committee, they all chanted “Wen token, wen lambo, wen gf!”. “Probably nothing,” said Corym. “We’re all gonna make it”, replied Wyn. “LFG join PleasrDao”, cried Jannalor - sounds meta.",
