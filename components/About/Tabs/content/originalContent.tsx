        The skies bellowed with thunder as Wyn and Jannalor jumped in their boat
        seeking for a new land. For days and nights they sailed in the raging
        Sea of Liquidity, unsure of what they’d find. <br /> Since the Faorin
        centralized control of their region, the towers in the city had become
        taller and brighter. Yet tales of arbitrary suffering grew as policies
        designed for the few impacted the many, and volatility of the annual
        harvests increased. Only one thing was certain: there had to be a better
        way. <br />
        They found adventurers from myriad backgrounds upon exploring. Wyn and
        Jannalar had been researchers, studying the minute details of the
        origins of high elvish magic, but what they found here was new even to
        them.

        They were soon joined by Corym, a High Elf from the Nordic faction,
        wielding a Bo staff made of Mallorn tree. Hailing from the House of
        Chadtham, he taught them ways of governing both the duties and the
        spoils of harvest. <br /> “We’ll teach them the way of the high elves,
        and we’ll learn from them. Our magic will grow stronger together,”
        Jannalor replied. Experimenting with spices from their new neighbours,
        they turned to a crop called Bacchae, long outlawed in the Old World for
        being too degenerate. <br /> With these elements combined, they tamed
        the harvest’s boom and bust cycles, allowing spices to flow at a steady
        rate. This brought stability to their farming efforts, and to their
        newfound way of life.

        Hearing of this prosperous harvest outside of their direct control, the
        Faorin quickly acted to halt all shipping and impose an embargo on all
        spice shipments across the Sea of Liquidity. <br /> “This aggression
        will not stand! The spice must flow!” raged Jannalor, determined to
        share their findings with their ancestors back home. <br />
        Channeling their newfound powers, the Elfi summoned a Portal right
        outside the tower city of the Faorin. An open challenge to ancient
        tradition invited all those who dared walk a new path. And it was then
        when their true adventure began.
