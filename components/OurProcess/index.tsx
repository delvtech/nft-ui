          This nascent form of Crypto Coven is a series of generative portraits
          of WITCHES, forged in this corner we&apos;ve carved out of the flat
          and open internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each WITCH manifests virtually as an array of pixels (in lieu of flesh
          and blood or sweat or paint), and each is unique, with a non-fungible
          token (NFT) stored on the Ethereum mainnet that attests to that
          uniqueness.
        </p>
        <p>
          While anyone may steal a WITCH&apos;S visage, if you hold a token, the
          identity you form and the treasures you reap from this world will
          travel with you to any web3 destination that may welcome a WITCH.
          Strangeness begets strangeness, and in coming days you&apos;ll see
          that number grow â€” we hope that you will grow it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this initial coven, each WITCH falls into an archetype of power
          and will be named, described, and articulated. May you take them into
          the metaverse and roam.
