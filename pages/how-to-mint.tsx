      <h1>Minting release</h1>
      <p>
        This process was designed with three aims: make distribution fair and
        transparent,<mark> ensure access for element community members, </mark>
        and favor humans over bots.
      </p>
      <h2>Community Pre-release</h2>
      <p>
        1,000 elves will be available to mint for element community members
        starting 5:35 p.m. ET on february 9 at <mark> completely free </mark>.
        Each person can mint up to 4 elves. <br /> Active community members are
        defined as anyone who has used element, the defi fixed rate protocol.
        <br /> These members will automatically receive
        <mark> their custom &quot;elf&quot; </mark>, which will grant them
        access to a private Discord channel
        <mark> (#custom-elfi)</mark> where they can get updates about future
        community involvement in the elfiverse and future nft related content.
        <br /> The community pre-release will be
        <mark> open indefinitely until we reach the cap of 1,000. </mark>
      </p>
      <h2>Public release</h2>
      <p>
        The remaining Elves (plus any remaining from the pre-release) will be
        available to mint for the general public at 12 p.m. ET on february 10 at
        <mark> completely free </mark>. Each person can mint up up to 4 elves,
        and this per-wallet cap includes any elves minted in the
        community-release or exchanged on secondary marketplaces.
      </p>
      <h2>Unveiling</h2>
      <p>
        The elves are revealed in weekly batches (Monday and Friday) to ensure
        that minters can&apos;t select their elves based on rarity. Minters may
        view their witches within a few days after minting them. <br />
        After an unveiling, you can always see your elf on our website
        immediately. Connect your wallet at the top right and click on the
        button to go to &quot;Your Wallet,&quot; where you&apos;ll be able to
        see your revealed elf. Wallets and platforms like OpenSea typically take
        a while (sometimes a few hours, sometimes as long as days) to update to
        the refreshed metadata. On your elf&apos;s OpenSea page, you can click a
        &quot;Refresh metadata&quot; button at the top right to request that
        OpenSea refresh the metadata more quickly.
      </p>
      <h2>Gifts</h2>
      <p>
        Each of our HIGH elves Council (the core team) and army (contributors)
        will receive a custom, regenerative-designed elf. <br /> Friends of
        elfiverse with significant followings may receive a elfi. <br />
        Community members who participate in the element governance system may
        be selected to receive a elfi.
