    </p>
    <h2>Minting Details</h2>
    <p>
      After minting, you will be able to see your elf on the Elfiverse website
      immediately. You will have to connect your wallet at the top right and
      click on the My Collection button to see your revealed elf. Wallets and
      NFT platforms typically take a while to update the refreshed metadata.

    <h2>The Elven Reserve</h2>
    <p>
      The Element DAO will be given control over minting and distribution for
      the remaining 2,500 ELFs, so that the DAO&apos;s governance participants
      can decide on the usage of the NFTs.
    </p>
    <h2>Non-investments</h2>
    <p>
      These ELF NFTs are not for sale. They are not investments or hold or
      represent anything of monetary value. The overarching goal of this NFT
      project is to foster a collaborative community around the Element DAO.
