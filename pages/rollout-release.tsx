    <h1>Rollout release</h1>
    <p>
      This process was designed with three aims: make distribution fair and
      transparent,<mark> ensure access for element community members,</mark> and
      favor humans over bots.
    </p>
    <h2>Community Pre-release</h2>
    <p>
      1,000 elves will be available to mint for element community members
      starting 5:35 p.m. ET on february 9 at <mark>completely free</mark>. Each
      person can mint up to 4 elves. <br /> Active community members are defined
      as anyone who has used element, the defi fixed rate protocol. <br /> These
      members will automatically receive
      <mark>their custom &quot;elf&quot;</mark>, which will grant them access to
      a private Discord channel
      <mark> (#custom-elfi)</mark> where they can get updates about future
      community involvement in the elfiverse and future nft related content.
      <br /> The community pre-release will be
      <mark> open indefinitely until we reach the cap of 1,000.</mark>
    </p>
    <h2>Public release</h2>
    <p>
      The remaining Elves (plus any remaining from the pre-release) will be
      available to mint for the general public at 12 p.m. ET on february 10 at
      <mark>completely free</mark>. Each person can mint up up to 4 elves, and
      this per-wallet cap includes any elves minted in the community-release or
      exchanged on secondary marketplaces.
    </p>
    <h2>Release details</h2>
    <p>
      After a release, you can always see your elf on our website immediately.
      <br />
      Connect your wallet at the top right and click on the button to go to
      &quot;Your Wallet,&quot; where you&apos;ll be able to see your revealed
      elf. Wallets and platforms like OpenSea typically take a while (sometimes
      a few hours, sometimes as long as days) to update to the refreshed
      metadata. On your elf&apos;s OpenSea page, you can click a &quot;Refresh
      metadata&quot; button at the top right to request that OpenSea refresh the
      metadata more quickly. <br />
      Rarities will be uncovered across drops to ensure the rare elves are well
      distributed among the community.
    </p>
    <h2>Gifts</h2>
    <p>
      Each of our HIGH elves Council (the core team) and army (contributors)
      will receive a custom, regenerative-designed elf. <br /> Friends of
      elfiverse with significant followings may receive a elfi. <br /> Community
      members who participate in the element governance system may be selected
      to receive a elfi.
