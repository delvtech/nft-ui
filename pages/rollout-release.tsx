    <h1>Rollout release</h1>
    <p>
      The elfiverse is a gift for the Element community to commemorate
      the launch of the Element DAO. An amplification of the community
      involvement in Element.

      The release schedule below was designed to enable a fair and
      transparent distribution that ensures accessibility of NFTs
      for <mark> all Element community members and prioritizes humans
      over the masses of bots.</mark>


    </p>
    <h2>First Release</h2>
    <p>

      An initial set of two thousand Elf(s) Will be available to mint starting
      at <mark> 6:09 p.m. EST on March 15, 2022. </mark> It will be accessible
      for active Element community members only and <mark> completely free. </mark>
      Each active community member will be able to mint one Elfi. <br /> Active
      community members are traders, LPs, and any community member that has used
      Element, the fixed rate protocol. <br /> Active community members will
      automatically receive their unique Elfi generated custom for
      their minting. Each elf contains traits that hold different
      rarities or formations stored in the Elfiverse library.
    </p>
    <h2>Second release</h2>
    <p>
    A second release of two thousand Elfis provides a second opportunity to
    participate, while opening up participation to a broader section of the
    community. This includes active members of the Element discord community
    as well members of the Ethereum ecosystem based on Github contributions.
    For more info on how we chose this set of community members and how you
    can participate, check out <mark> this link. </mark>

    </p>
    <h2>Third Release</h2>
    <p>
      Details of the final release are to be announced.
    </p>
    <h2>Release and Minting Details</h2>
    <p>
      After a release and mint release, you will be able to see
      your elf on the Elfiverse website immediately. You will
      need to connect your wallet at the top right and click
      on the My Collection button to see your revealed elf.
      Wallets and platforms like OpenSea typically take a while
      (sometimes a few hours, sometimes as long as days) to update
      the refreshed metadata. Each member of the High Elves Council
      (the core team) and army (contributors) may also receive a custom,
      regenerative-designed elf.
